# Car Evaluation

Comparison of two ML models for Classification using U.C.I. Car Evaluation Data set

Machine Learning models applied to the car evaluation data can provide clear commercial direction and competition-benefit 
to manufacturer’s since desirable features can be embedded in the future design process. Herein we compare a Naive Bayes 
approach with a bagged decision tree model which extends to a random forest model upon hyper-parameter tuning. We 
critically assess our results with those of W. Piraya and Behzad, whom also built classification models for this same 
car evaluation data-set.
